# ItelexLogger
The idea of ItelexLogger is to connect a PC via RS232 (real or USB adapter) to the i-telex debug port. ItelexLogger analyses the debug information, extracts all plain text information and displays it. All text information and all debug outputs are written to two separate log files.

Important: In the i-Telex setup, set the "Logging level at serial port" to 4.
